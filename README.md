This is just a small side project that I'm making in my ongoing journey to learn how to make games with the Unreal Engine and C++

Here are some of the features that I'm proud of:

I used the UE5 niagara system for the engine thruster effect. The color is determined by current speed.

The ship does have blasters! I used the niagara system for this feature as well.

The Asteroids do spin! The spinning logic was written with C++

The ship can crash and explode! For this I had to learn how to use field systems to break apart geometry collections. Also I got more experience using the UE5 niagara system.

The ship now has a space themed skybox attached to it. This adds a very nice outer space feel.

Adding the outer space theme made things a little dark so I decided to add some headlights that can be toggled on and off.
